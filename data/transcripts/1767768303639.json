    "text": "you may have heard a lot about rewarding recently it conjures up visions of vast landscapes reintroductions of wolves great herds of bison it's the most important message we can hear at the moment that nature can restore itself given the chance but it doesn't have to be a vast scale and it doesn't have to be in the middle of nowhere rewarding can happen in your own backyard in an urban park anywhere there's a tiny patches space for it and it can happen really fast and that's transformative not just for nature and the climate but for ourselves how do i know well for the past couple of decades i've been hoping to reward big and small when my husband was twenty one he inherited three thousand five hundred acres of farmland in the busy south east of england never state is on the worst possible land for intensive agriculture it was already losing money but charlie a trained as a farmer and so for seventeen years he tried to turn it around by nineteen ninety nine we will one and a half million pounds and debt we knew we had to do something radically different we wanted to work with nature rather battling against it all the time we began to re wild europe like africa and all the other continents of the world was once home to vast numbers of of free roaming animals animals that we hunted to extinction or close to it they're disturbances shape the land they cleared forests they opened up wetlands and created grasslands they stimulated the soil they spread seeds we were really excited by large scale rewarding projects happening in europe that was showing that by introducing these animals back into landscape that nature could could recover that biodiversity could could rocket but could it actually happened at smaller scale could it happen on a farm like cause that had been cloud and drenched with chemicals for decades could we bring our own land back to life the first steps were so much fun we pulled up all the internal fences we smashed up the victorian drains we allowed the was to sit where it had always wanted to sit and the fields began to scrub up with thorny bushes and soon trees began to recall a nice and then we ringfence the whole area and began to introduce our free roaming animals old english longhorn cattle for their extinct ancestor the or rocks x more ponies for the extinct top on tom was pigs for wild boar read and fallow deer and eventually beavers the results were beyond our wildest dreams everywhere these animals went life surfaced in their wake land became a kaleidoscope of complex shifting habitats the kind of messy margins that wildlife loves soon we were hearing nightingale is entitled to loves birds on the verge of extinction in britain we had bats and owls and dung beetles and butterflies homing in on us as if out of nowhere and i saw was restoring to so suddenly we're pulling down vast amounts of carbon whereas before under the plow we just been releasing it and all of this happened in five years we looked at our land in amazement it was like it was breathing a sigh of relief and so were we suddenly we could just sit back and watch the miracle of the earth restoring itself of course we couldn't just let the numbers of animals grow and grow in our small projects biodiversity flourishes when there are neither too many grazing animals know too few in vast wilderness areas nature takes care of his herself but we don't have wolves and links and bears in the south east of england so we had to pick come the apex predator and that meant suddenly we had an income stream that surprised us we had was range meat and together with wildlife tourism is become one of the ways we can finance rewarding it's turn the fortunes of the estate around inspired by net hundreds of thousands of acres and now rewarding in the uk on land that isn't suitable for intensive modern agriculture but of course not everybody has hundreds of acres to play with and soon we were receiving messages from people who had seen the magic of net but one to to know if they could reward their back garden their schoolyard the urban park yes you can our house has a victorian will garden of about an acre in size that for years was dominated by a monoculture lawn lawrence have become an obsession the world over ever since the nineteen fifties when artificial fertilizer we killers and marine machines became available to everyone we looked again at our high carbon high maintenance green desert and wonder why on earth we had it three years ago we decided to re wild it it's become a wildlife haven in just three years biodiversity has increased thirty five percent rewarding a garden isn't about simply closing the garden gate and letting it go it takes intentional interventions to create the right balance of plants and to create the kind of habitats that wildlife loves so this is what we've learnt these are all three top tips for making your green space and garden wilder first the earth is not flat in nature their amounts of anthills a mole hills and pits made by pigs and wallows made by rolling bison creating lumps and bumps produces patches of son and shade and damp and dry which create conditions for me much wider spectrum of plants and that creates many more opportunities for wildlife we happen to have some old farm buildings that we were demolishing nearby so we also diggers if they were common dump hundreds of tons of crush brick and concrete on to our perfected lawn you may have a patio or piece of concrete or tarmac that you can pull up crush it up a mix it with sand and you have the perfect free training medium for a dry garden in a dry garden you can have plans like wallflowers that really love poor soul conditions and because you're not having to water and fertilize you're saving yourself a lot of time and money but you're also helping the planet we've planted eleven hundred different plants mostly from are parts of the world but you didn't have to have that many you can make an enormous impact just by choosing plants that insects love and by extending the pollen eighteen and next season and supporting forgotten creatures like night flying months some of our greatest pollinators and all of these plants a rubbing shoulders with on native self seeding wallflowers we vowed never to use the word we'd again you can learn to love your dandelions and clover second think like a herbivore when the job of a gardener is never to allow one single plant to dominate if you do you lose all those plants that are creating species richness in your garden so when you're pulling out the suggs think of yourself as a wild boar ruling out those dogs and thistles and when you're pruning your roses are your climbers your the nibbling teeth of a deer sinking of lot of yourself as an animal in an ecosystem is incredibly freeing it allows you to become more holistic an organic it allows you to get messier the still room for lawn and the walls or garden but think of it as part of the mosaic consider a wallflower or camomile lawn and when you mow be the cow graze very tightly in some areas but allow others to stay long providing protection for small mammals and birds mix it up grow mohican finally find life and death in nature death is a primary source of life but in a garden we get rid of anything that dies leaving dead word and pause of leaves is fantastic habitat but it also creates natural fertilizer for next year's growth and leaving seat heads instead of obsessive leader deadheading provides really important food for birds over winter in the uk we have twenty three million private gardens covering an area for and a half times the amount of land that is designated to national nature reserves and most of those gardens are dominated by a green desert long imagine if all those gardeners thought differently if they put away the artificial fertilizer and the herbicides and began to think of themselves as a keystone species as a mole on and to an earthworm like this amazing city gardner who's become obsessed with bees everything from bumble bees to a short tailed beast to leave cause obese to masonry bees to think of bees as aggressive and scary but if you watch them they're just gentle sensitive creatures going about their business you can fall in love with them this is our neighbors garden now attracting nightingales and twenty hours we can reward balconies and cities even in high rise blocks even a window box can become a nature reserve and cemeteries and churchyards the bus shelters and whole streets we can reward our public monuments this is the tower of london now a wallflower meadow heaving with bees and this is the field museum in chicago once a green desert and now a vital food stop for birds or migration we can have whole tower blocks erupting plants bringing life to our window sills capturing carbon producing oxygen cleaning the air insulating us in winter cooling us down and summer so much of rewarding is about changing the aesthetic it's about questioning what we've always been taught to think of as beautiful a normal and stated it's about shedding are obsessions particularly our desire to be always an absolute control rewarding is about embracing the messy and the unpredictable it's about letting go it's about rewarding ourselves thank you"
