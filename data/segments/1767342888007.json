        " Picture this.\n\nYou're going on a boat trip, and you get on board with your family, and  you got your bags, and the captain comes out to greet you and says, hi, my name's Montana,  uh, Von Fliss.\n\nOh, I'll be your captain for this journey.\n\nSo, uh, oh boy, let's just  have a great trip.\n\nSorry.\n\nNope.\n\nGet me off of this boat.\n\nWhat we want in that moment is  for the captain to walk out and say, hi, my name is Montana Von Fliss.\n\nI'll be your  captain for this journey.\n\nLet's have a great trip.\n\nThe point is, when you are the  speaker, you are the captain for that journey, and how you show up really matters.",
        "\n\n For the last 17 years, I've coached thousands of speakers all over the  world, from big tech companies to small startups, and everyone from new hires to  CEOs of Fortune 500 companies want to know, how do you show up and look confident? So,  I'd like to share my top five tips for how to be confident, even if you're not.",
        "\n\nSo,  let's break it down.\n\nWhat was the difference between those two captains?  What did you see? What did you hear? And not just, you know, one seemed nervous,  one seemed confident, but what was I doing differently to make you think  that? Different volume, different words, certainly different body language.\n\nBut the  truth is, I wasn't actually feeling particularly confident.\n\nI was just making  certain physical and vocal choices to make you think that.\n\nYou can do that too.\n\n Anyone can do this.\n\nSo, what are those confident looking choices? Number one,  turn up the energy and speak up.",
        "\n\nWhen you speak up, even just a little bit, it reads  as confident.\n\nAnd you don't have to shout, think about it this way.\n\nOn a scale of one  to 10, aim for a five.\n\nYes, it goes to 11.\n\nBut you can just aim for a five.\n\nI'm here  at a five right now.\n\nI can bring it back down to a three down here.\n\nNervous captain  was down here.\n\nAnd then we bring it back up to a five.\n\nAnd it sounds prepared,  positive and confident.\n\nSo, turn up the energy and speak up.\n\nNumber two, pause,  like a boss.\n\nNervous speakers tend to talk really fast, right? And then when  they do have a pause, they fill it in with verbal filler, likes and ums.\n\n However, if you try to speak more slowly, it just sounds like this, right? And  that's not better.\n\nSo, instead, make strategic pauses.\n\nPause in transition.\n\n Pause for emphasis.\n\nPause, like a boss.\n\nNumber three, superhero stance.\n\nImagine you  are a superhero.\n\nYou can do it from your chair.\n\nHow would a superhero sit? Yes,  let that change your posture.",
        "\n\nI see you.\n\nYes, let that bring a smile to your face.\n\n And have some better eye contact.\n\nAll of that reads as confident.\n\nAnd pretending to be a superhero is  just a super quick way to have confident looking body language.\n\nNow this one also goes to 11.\n\n But you can just aim for a five and that will be great.\n\nTuck in that cape and go save the day.",
        "\n\n And you can stand in superhero backstage to boost your confidence.\n\nBut I'm saying,  bring that superhero stance on stage so that your audience sees you as confident.\n\n And if you need an easy shortcut, just make the shape.\n\nJust make the shape of a confident  person.\n\nThe audience cannot read your mind.\n\nThey don't know how you're feeling.\n\nSo,  just make the shape and they will go with it.\n\nLike, if you came over to my house for dinner  and I open up the door and I was like, hi, come on in.\n\nWe're having chicken.\n\n You'd be like, oh, is this a bad time? You know, you've got to make the shape  of a good host.\n\nMake the smile shape, right? Instead of crossed arm shape, open up.\n\nHi, welcome.\n\n Come on in.\n\nIf you're not sure if you're making confident looking choices,  you can just video yourself and watch it back.\n\nI feel like I just saw you say,  not doing that one.\n\nI know most people don't like to watch themselves.\n\nI get it.\n\n But wouldn't you rather make that adjustment before you're in front of your audience?  Yes.",
        "\n\nVideoing yourself is a great way to check in to see that you're doing the techniques,  but also to see that it's still authentically you, your version of confident captain.\n\n Now, how can you do all of these things on performance day? Number four, practice with  purpose.\n\nSo make yourself a rehearsal schedule, put it in your calendar.\n\nYou can give yourself a  little treat when you do a run through and make it practice with purpose by giving yourself a  specific goal or layering in one new confident captain technique each day.\n\nIf it's a week before  your event, aim to run it all the way through at least once a day.\n\nAnd if you don't have  time for a full run through, just take the opening closing, run that three times in a row from anywhere.\n\n When you're in the shower and when you're walking your dog, when you're making a meal for your kids,  I know my kids are very used to me walking around the house talking to myself.",
        "\n\n Whatever you need to do to get in those repetitions and don't be afraid of over practice.\n\n Don't let that stop you.\n\nYou can just let go of your verbatim script if it's starting to sound  robotic, and you can still use, you know, bullet point speaker notes to remind yourself  of what you would like to say and to invite you to say it a little bit differently each time  to keep it fresh.\n\nAnd let me be clear, by practice, I mean standing up, saying it out loud,  imagining your audience and inviting them in, clicking through your slides, doing it as much  like it will be on the day, whether it's virtual or in person.\n\nAnd I know it might feel a little funny  saying it out loud to yourself.\n\nBut think about when you learn a new sport or when you practice  a musical instrument, if you had a piano concert on Friday and you got new music on Monday,  would you only read your music every day and then play it for the very first time at the concert  on Friday? No way.",
        "\n\nAnd yet I see speakers do this all the time.\n\nGive yourself a chance.\n\n Practice helps everything.\n\nAnd it can really boost your confidence to practice with purpose  by layering in one new technique each day.\n\nOkay, those first four techniques, they're all about  how to appear confident, regardless of how you're feeling.\n\nI've got one more technique for you,  and it's a big one.\n\nBut this is the real gem.\n\nIt's the one that makes all the others shine.",
        "\n\n This is number five, the silent sentence.\n\nThis is about what you choose to tell yourself.\n\n I've been a professional actor since I was a kid, and I have always loved going on stage as an actor,  as a speaker, as an emcee.\n\nAnd at the same time, I have often been not just nervous, sometimes  downright terrified to step on a stage.\n\nI'm shaking, I'm sweating, and I'm like,  what was I thinking? Why do I do this to myself? And all these unhelpful voices flood in, and I  just tried to make it stop, push it away, and of course that never worked.\n\nAnd I kept going  on stage because I love it.\n\nAnd years later, when I became a speaker coach, I got asked to  do all these professional presentations, and they went, well, but I still had no way to deal  with that massive anxiety.\n\nAnd I was like, what can I do? And I thought, well, what am I telling  myself? What if you mess up? You better be perfect.",
        "\n\nI realized I was giving myself an  impossible instruction to be perfect.\n\nAnd that really was not working.\n\nBut what would work?  What would be a better message? And to figure that out, I had to go back to square one, like,  what do I want? Why did I say yes to this speaking gig? What is my deeper purpose here?  And I realized at the heart of it, I just want to help my audience to the best of my  ability.",
        "\n\nAnd when I said that, I noticed everything change.\n\nThat's where I found my first  silent sentence.\n\nI want to help my audience to the best of my ability.\n\nWhen I said it even  silently to myself, it acted like this override switch.\n\nLike, I might still be shaking and  sweating, but now I have this higher goal, this deeper purpose, and everything aligned to that,  and that became my highest priority.\n\nI want to help you.\n\nAnd now that thought replaced those  unhelpful thoughts, and everything went better in my performance.\n\nAnd I was like, yes! It worked!  Yay! And then I was like, wait, how do I do this every time? Especially when the stakes are high.",
        "\n\n And it dawned on me.\n\nLike, if I'm writing and crafting the words I say out loud, why not write  and craft the words I say silently to myself? Put it in the script.\n\nIt's the silent part  of the script.\n\nSo now, every time I rehearse, every time I walk onto a stage, every time  I join a virtual meeting, I say the following new and evolved silent sentence.\n\n I invite you to be here with me while I am here with you, so that I can make this easier for you.\n\n Now, that invitation to myself to be present, that's my definition of stage presence.\n\n Being present.\n\nAnd that invitation to the audience to be my partner, that reminds me,  these are friends, not foes, and I am choosing to be here.",
        "\n\nAnd now I'm not just making the shape  of a good host, I really am a good host because I am genuinely welcoming you to my world.\n\n Now, how do you go about finding your silent sentence?  What do you want? What's your deeper purpose? You could be like me, and you might just want to  help people.\n\nOr it could be something more specific.\n\nFor example, you might want at least one person  in your audience to walk out and take a CPR class.",
        "\n\nOr maybe you're just super excited to have  this experience or share with them some cool solution you have for their problem.\n\n You get to fill in the blank and decide what you want to accomplish.\n\nAnd this is not about  graduating to some higher level of being where you never again feel nervous.\n\n I know I haven't.\n\nI was feeling it pretty big about 15 minutes ago.\n\n Well, we're getting ready to walk on this stage.\n\nAnd I am, and probably always will be  a recovering perfectionist.\n\nThat is a well-worn pathway in my brain.",
        "\n\nIt is there, it exists,  it cannot be erased.\n\nBut now I have this other pathway.\n\nAnd when big moments like this come up,  I get to choose.\n\nAnd that's what I was doing back there in the wings.\n\nI was choosing  to gently insist on repeating my silent sentence to set myself up for success.\n\n What we tell ourselves really matters.\n\nWe follow our own instructions all day long.\n\n Our whole selves are always listening.\n\nSo when you notice something isn't going well  or you're fearing something might not go well in the future, use this checklist.\n\n What am I telling myself? What's being broadcast? Then replace that with a  better sentence to help set you up for where you'd like to go.\n\nAnd most importantly,  put it in the script and practice it.\n\nPractice it just as much as the words you say out loud.",
        "\n\n So if you're running your intro in the shower three times in a row,  it would go silent bit, out loud bit, silent out loud, silent out loud until it is inextricably linked.\n\n And it is just a part of your process.\n\nAnd it is repeatable and reliable.\n\n And then it's just there for you when you need it.\n\nNow I want to leave you with this final thought.\n\n When you're at home and you're practicing some of these techniques like  turn up the energy and speak up.\n\nPause like a boss.\n\nSuperhero stance.\n\nPractice with purpose.\n\n And your silent sentence.\n\nPlease know that it might feel uncomfortable at first because it's new  and that is normal.",
        "\n\nBut think back to when I was demonstrating the nervous captain at the top.\n\n How did that make you feel? And then when the confident captain came out, oh, what a relief.\n\n Now I can just sit back and enjoy the ride.\n\nRemember that feeling of safety you had as an  audience member and bring that into your next rehearsal.\n\nYou can give that gift to your audience.\n\n Reach outside your comfort zone to make your audience feel safe by making the choices  of a confident captain.\n\nAnd who knows, you might even have fun.\n\nHave a great trip.\n\n You"
